## a. Write a Python program to add member(s) in a set and clear a set.

#A new empty set
student = set()
print("\nAdd single element:")
student.add("20CS083")
print(student)
print("\nAdd multiple items:")
student.update(["20CS087", "20CS101"])
print(student)

student.clear()
print("\nAfter using clear:")
print(student)

## b. Write a Python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the set.

#Create a new set
A = set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Original set elements:")
print(A)
print("\nRemove 4 from the said set:")
A.discard(4)
print(A)
print("\nRemove 5 from the said set:")
A.discard(5)
print(A)

## c. Write a Python program to create an intersection, Union, difference of sets.

# sets are defined
A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  
# union
print("Union :", A | B)
  
# intersection
print("Intersection :", A & B)
  
# difference
print("Difference :", A - B)
 

## d. Write a Python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set.

#Create a set
A = {0,4,2,100,-1,-6,2.3}
print("Original set elements:")
print(A)
print("\nMaximum value of the said set:")
print(max(A))
print("\nMinimum value of the said set:")
print(min(A))

## e. Write a Python program to find the most common elements and their counts from list, tuple, dictionary.

## List
from collections import Counter
s = [1,2,3,4,4,4]
print(s)
print("Most common element:")
print(Counter(s).most_common(1))

## Tuple
A=(1,2,3,4,5,6,1,1,1)
max=0
for x in A:
    count = A.count(x)
    if(count > max):
        max=count
        num=x

print("The number occuring the most is: ",num)        
print("It occurs ",max,"times.")
