## a. Write a Python program to create a tuple with different data types.

A = ("Tuple", True, 3.2, 1)
print(A)


## b. Write a Python program to create a tuple with numbers and print one item.

#Create a tuple with numbers
A = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
print(A)
#Create a tuple of one item
A = 5,
print(A)


## c. Write a Python program to add an item in a tuple.

#create a tuple
A = (4, 6, 2, 8, 3, 1) 
print(A)
#tuples are immutable, so you can not add new elements
#using + operator we can add an element and it will create a new tuple
A = A + (9,)
print(A)


## d. Write a Python program to convert a tuple to a string.

#create a tuple
A = (4, 6, 2, 8, 3, 1) 
#converting the tuple to list
listx = list(A) 
# different ways to add items in list
listx.append(30)
A = tuple(listx)
print(A)

## e. Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple.

#create a tuple
A = tuple("CHARUSTA")
print(A)
#using the len() function to known the length of tuple
print(len(A))
